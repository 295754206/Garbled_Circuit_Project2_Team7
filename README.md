# **Garbled Circuit**

> Garbled Circuit with two version. Version 1 is unfinished but only has a basic concept with garbled circuit.
> Version 2 has been finished the most important encryption function.

## Version 1
> Realize the manual input custom gate circuit, and then synthesize any custom combination circuit, and get the truth table function, but there is a requirement that each layer of the combination circuit need to have at least one gate.
## Version 2

> Implement that all circuit have to ipnut manually. By the way, only support combinational circuit and must input with hierarchy. 

#### Input Format
The input begin with a binary string, which indicates the garbled input.

#### Output Format
Output lines, each line has a wire name and a number either 0 or 1.


#### Technical Specification

#### Sample Input:
> 11  
> W1  
> AND1 AND A B W1  
>  

#### Sample Output:
> W1 1

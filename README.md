# **Garbled Circuit**

> Garbled Circuit with two version. Version 1 is unfinished but only has a basic concept with garbled circuit.
> Version 2 has been finished the most important encryption function.

## Version 1
> Realize the manual input custom gate circuit, and then synthesize any custom combination circuit, and get the truth table function, but there is a requirement that each layer of the combination circuit need to have at least one gate.

## Version 2 (Main)
> Implement that all circuits have to read from "circuit" directory. By the way, only support the combinational circuit and must be with hierarchy.

### Circuit Description Format
The first line contains all of the circuit input name tag, separate with space.  
The second line contains all of the circuit output name tag, separate with space.  


#### Input Format
The input only have one line string ***s*** with 0 or 1.  
It would read the circuit description file from `./circuit/gc` and input string length ***l<sub>s</sub>*** must same as the number of circuit input.

#### Output Format
Output ***lo*** lines, each line has a wire name tag and a number either 0 or 1.
